Hey,
I'm starting to read the Django docs these days. (how important, isn't it? 🤡)
\
I just wanted to leave this so that I can check my progress in the future.
\
\
My reason for starting was that I wanted to seriously start reading the framework documentation for the first time to get to know all the ins and outs of Django. (maybe I can contribute later, can I? 💀)
\
\
Actually, I watched lots of courses & tutorials, but I think that reading docs itself is like communicating directly with the main developers of this project, in a way, I'm talking directly with the developers and it's like they're teaching me how Django is written and works.
\
\
Of course, docs can't show everything that's going on, but at least it's better than the tutorials out there and can give a good overview of the whole project. (u agree? 🧐)

To read docs & highlight the important or interesting parts, I found an extension that can always save the highlight so that you can see your highlights when you visit the site later.
Also, by using its shortcut, you can work with it much more easily. I really like it 🫦
\
Hope its developer will come back & add the **share** feature to the project, this makes it more useful (:
